This is a test trying to turn around a problem that I have for deploy 
an contract.
If you have eperienced the error when deploy, you could try the following:
download gzip
unzipped contract
try to compile compi.sh
build bld.sh
deploy depl.sh

If ok, then you have an program for cp -r to another folder and replace it for your
lib.rs and test.rs

THIS IS A TEST. UNDER YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY.DONT USE BEFORE YOU HAVE BACK YOUR FILES
